Running the Code
---------------------------------
- To scrape data, run "python datascrape.py" in terminal.  Alternatively, you can run "datascrape.py" in a Python Shell.  "datascrape.py" requires the pattern library for web scraping.  Scraped data is outputed to "project2.csv".

- To view web visualization, open "index.html" in a web browser (e.g. Firefox, Chrome, IE).

---------------------------------
File Details
---------------------------------
"datascrape.py" - scrapes movie data between 2000 and 2012 on IMDb website.

"index.html" - imports libraries from the web or locally (e.g. D3) and dictates the placement of the web visualization elements (e.g. svg, lines, circles).  D3 is hosted externally.

"main.js" - contains all the javascript for handling drawing the svg visualization, handling dropdown changes and interactivity within the svg.

"style.css" - controls the style formatting of DOM elements.  Lines, circles, tooltips, etc. are stylized with this file.

"project2.csv" - main csv data file that contains all movie data between 2000 and 2012, scraped for several variables.  It is imported into index.html as a <textarea>.
